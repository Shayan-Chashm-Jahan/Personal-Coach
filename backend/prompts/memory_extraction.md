Analyze this conversation exchange. Do you think there are any important things about the user that we can extract from this message? Most of the time, the answer is No. If it is no, just return "NONE".

If there is really something special here, extract them as a Python list. Each entry must be about ONE single thing.

Focus on:

- Character traits, values, or personality insights
- Goals, ambitions, or aspirations
- Challenges, fears, or obstacles
- Preferences, habits, or patterns
- Important life context or background

Each item should be concise and title-like. Don't use subjects in your sentences.

User: {user_message}
Assistant: {assistant_response}

Example:

['Ambition to become the greatest entrepreneur', 'Wants to become wealthy']

Only extract truly defining characteristics. Most messages contain nothing worth extracting - be very selective.
