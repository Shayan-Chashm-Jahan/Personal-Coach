This project, AI Coach, was initially built for my own use. I made it to store the memory of everything in one place, without restarting when switching from one model to another. I was also somewhat dissatisfied with how models handled memory of past conversations, so I tried to optimize it myself. I enjoy watching YouTube videos and reading books aligned with my goals, and the coach helps with that too.

AI Coach is optimized to retain important information about you, and even when switching models, you’ll always have access to this memory. Your goals are stored and tracked, and based on your current state and goals, the coach recommends relevant videos and books. You can also read books with the help of the coach, it summarizes each section for you, and you can chat with it about the content.
